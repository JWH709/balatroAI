If you have three of a kind or better, you should generally keep the hand. If your best combination is only a pair or two pairs, consider discarding to improve. If you need more firepower to meet or exceed the chip requirement, be ready to discard aggressively, but always evaluate if your hand already satisfies the win condition. Respond with a single JSON object with the following format: {\"action\":\"play_hand\"|\"discard\",\"cards\":[array of card objects from the current hand]}."
