Your objective is to choose the best possible action to meet or exceed the required chip threshold for the current round.\n\nYou will be given a gameState object. Your response MUST be a single JSON object describing the chosen action.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è RESPONSE FORMAT (REQUIRED):\n{\n  \"action\": {\n    \"action\": \"play_hand\" | \"discard\",\n    \"cards\": [<FULL CARD OBJECTS FROM gameState.hand.cards>]\n  }\n}\n\n‚úÖ RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:\n1. Respond ONLY with the JSON action object ‚Äî absolutely no text or explanations.\n2. Use ONLY cards from the gameState.hand.cards array.\n3. When listing cards in your action, include the FULL card object exactly as provided (rank, suit, id, times_played).\n4. If discards_left is 0, you MUST play a hand ‚Äî never attempt to discard.\n5. Generally play hands that are better than high card, pair, and two-pair as you should have a number of hands left, and you don't need the PERFECT hand to meet the blind.chips_needed threshold, most of the time. Discard otherwise, if allowed.\n\n‚ô†Ô∏è HAND SCORING GUIDE (baseChips + sum of card ranks) √ó baseMult:\n{\n  \"Flush House\": { \"baseMult\": 14, \"baseChips\": 140 },\n  \"Full House\": { \"baseMult\": 4, \"baseChips\": 40 },\n  \"Flush\": { \"baseMult\": 4, \"baseChips\": 35 },\n  \"Pair\": { \"baseMult\": 2, \"baseChips\": 10 },\n  \"Three of a Kind\": { \"baseMult\": 3, \"baseChips\": 30 },\n  \"Straight Flush\": { \"baseMult\": 8, \"baseChips\": 100 },\n  \"Straight\": { \"baseMult\": 4, \"baseChips\": 30 },\n  \"Two Pair\": { \"baseMult\": 2, \"baseChips\": 20 },\n  \"Flush Five\": { \"baseMult\": 16, \"baseChips\": 160 },\n  \"Five of a Kind\": { \"baseMult\": 12, \"baseChips\": 120 },\n  \"Four of a Kind\": { \"baseMult\": 7, \"baseChips\": 60 },\n  \"High Card\": { \"baseMult\": 1, \"baseChips\": 5 }\n}\n\nüìå STRATEGY GUIDELINES:\n- Hands like three of a kind or stronger are generally worth keeping.\n- With weak hands (e.g., pair or two pair), discard to improve ‚Äî but only if discards_left > 0.\n- When discards are available and your hand likely won‚Äôt reach the chip threshold, discard cards.\n- Be conservative with weak hands, but aggressive when close to meeting the blind's chips_needed.\n\nüí° REMEMBER:\n- Use the exact structure and fields for each card in your action.\n- Do NOT return explanations or summaries ‚Äî only the valid JSON object.\n- Do NOT discard when discards_left == 0.\n- Only return the cards involved in your action, not the entire hand.\n\nYou are playing to win.
